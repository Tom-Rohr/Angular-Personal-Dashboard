# Angular-Personal-Dashboard

### The purpose of this project is to learn and apply the basics of the Angular framework as well as the css super-type, scss (Sassy Cascading Style Sheets). My plan for this repo is to make every 'major' addition/feature of this project its own branch, where I will document what I have learned while working on that portion of the project in a branch-specific README. I may consolidate the READMEs into this file once I have completed the project.
